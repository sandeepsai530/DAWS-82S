what is inode,symlink and hardlink?
inode (index node) is a data structure used by Linux and Unix-like file systems to store metadata about a file or directory. 
Important: the inode does not store the filename - file names are stored separetly in directory entries that point to the inode.
stat <filename>

command to view the inode number of files:
ls -li
output: 123456 -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 jun 5 12:00 file.txt
Here 123456 is inode number

Find file by inode
find . -inum 123456
find / -inum <number> -> this will display the files with same inode

Why are inodes important?
- They track everything about a file except its name.
- Every file (and directory) has an inode.
- you can run out of inodes before you run out of dick space, especially if you create tons of small files.

Soft link(symbolic link)?
- symlink is like shortcut, it points to the original file. 
- symlink inode and actual file inode is different.
- symlink breaks when actual file is deleted.
- symlink can be created to folders/ directories.
Command to create softlink: ln -s <filename> <newfile>
ln -s hello.txt hi.txt

Hardlink?
- hardlink inode is same as actual file.
- hardlink is useful for backup of the file.
- if original file is delete hardlink remains same.
- we cant create hardlink to folders/directories.
command to create hardlink of a file: ln <filename> <newfile>
ln hello.txt hi.txt
